# Example Environment Variables Configuration
# 
# This file serves as a template for setting up environment variables in your 
# application. It contains placeholders for the keys and configuration settings 
# you need to replace with your actual values.
#
# To use this template:
# 1. Rename this file to '.env' and replace the placeholder values with your actual 
#    API keys and credentials.
# 2. Ensure that you add your real keys to this file and keep it secure.
# 3. This file should not be committed to version control. Instead, add your 
#    '.env' file to your .gitignore to prevent sensitive information from being 
#    exposed.
#
# Environment Variables:
# - GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key for accessing Gemini AI services.
# - CLERK_SECRET_KEY: Your secret key for Clerk authentication services.
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: Your publishable key for Clerk authentication (public use).

# - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your API key for Stripe payment services.
